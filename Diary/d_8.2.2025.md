Hi guys, it's me again, today me and my dad had a walk instead of my mom because they have decided to change who will have a walk with me yesterday. I think jogging is okay, although it's quite boring. 

Today, I will continue learning more about algorithms and programming. One thing I can not learn recently is that OOP, I think I didn't spend time efficiently enough to learn it, but if I want to create my own program, I have to rush now.

Yesterday, I practiced on Codeforces, I found it quite interesting but the testcases were hidden so it was really hard. If I want to improve my problem-solving skill, maybe I should wait until I have learn DSA.

Oh now I'm remember something, yesterday is my pupil's birthday, yeah I know I really want to wish him happy birthday but I forgot. Am I a bad teacher? I will meet him tonight, maybe I will do it.

By the way, recently I forget to practice English as well, am I being lazy like before :))???

I started exercising again yesterday, haizz every vacation i have to do this. 

And I know this platform can let user to personally customize interface and tool. I think I should learn about it, this look like a hypertext, oh wait, can I insert image in this note?? Let me see.

Oh it really works, I'm wondering whether can I insert other type of files. Dang, I can even insert video?? 

Haha it's fun, currently I watching AOT again, the Vietnamese-dubbing version is quite amazing, I can see more about character's feelings. The movie has been released, should I join my friend and come to see it with her? I think it would be impolite if after a long time no talking and I invite her to see a movie. 

I think I can make my note more colorful.



This is my intention today:
* Continuing practicing with Leetcode, may be Codeforces as well.
* Learning OOP (üê∏üê∏üê∏ I'm not sure this one).
* Learning English (Should I learn technical terms??).
* Continue Cardio
