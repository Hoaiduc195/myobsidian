#diary
Hello me in another day, today is the first day i decide to write diary. May be this will be my hobby in some day.
After a semester in HCMUS, i think my result was quite good, although I'm still very disappointed.
And some of my goals have become almost complete, I'm quite optimistic about next goals.

Morever, in this Tet holiday, me and my family have chance to go on a trip to Vung Tau Beach. The coast was amazing, that is the first time me and my family see the sea. I think that day was amazing. Simultaneously in that day, my keyboard arrived, it's amazing as well. Thanks to my new keyboard, now I can write and code more better.

My next intention:
* Learn more new algorithms and new concepts about programming
* Improve Listening and Writting Skill.
* Learn OOP.

May be my note today is long enough. See you later!!

Postscript: Today I learned a new formula to calculate the highest power of prime p that divides n!
(Legendre's Theorem)
Repostscript: SMITH numbers and SPHENIC numbers.
