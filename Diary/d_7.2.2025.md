#diary
Hello everyone, today is the second day I've started my writing diary, I don't know how long I will maintain this work, but it's still quite fun currently.
In this day, I woke up early and have an exercise with my mom in the morning when the sun hasn't risen. I think I'm feeling better. But I think I have to continue jogging everyday to have a good health. By the way, I don't know but my back has been quite painful since the Tet holiday. May be I have to go to see a doctor if this continues. 

My intention today:
* Continue learning algorithms and practicing Leetcode.
* Learning OOP.
* Practice English.

I don't know why but OOP is quite hard for me. It seems to be a professional skill acquired for any software engineer and I must learn it. By the way, I'm thinking about a project where I can apply SFML, but I'm still thinking about the concept of the project. 

Last night, I chat with my friend and he said I should post my face on my platform, üê∏üê∏üê∏ I think it will be my choice in some day, but obviously not this time. I'm still out of shape and lost my dream body. I think I should start exercise cardio again.  

And something going wrong, maybe I'm having insomnia, it quite annoying when I can sleep in night but be sleepy in day. May be, I should take a measure to solve this soon.

Postscript: Should I learn about FE? Cybersecurity is my preference but SE is quite amazing, I can see my result sooner and my products can be used by everyone.
