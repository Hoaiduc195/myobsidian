#diary
It has been a long time since the last diary, I will have the end term exam in the next 2 weeks. In few days so far, I learn something new from Obsidian. Actually, Obsidian is so amazing, taking notes in this app make me feel extremely want to learn new things constantly. Therefore, I decide to use Obsidian to prepare for my endterm DSA exam.

Today I register for a position in Machine Learning research team founded by my DSA teacher, I think this must be a big oppotunity. However, I have to prepare for this, this means in the next semester, I can be exhausting. To prevent my mind from feeling bored and negative, I have to change my mindset.

One important thing that I have to take the TOEIC exam in this summer as well. The course I register seems quite useless cause I don't have time for it (I'm lazy actually), may be I should start the speaking and writing soon after enroll the contest.

Since I have known a little bit about Obsidian, I think I will use this more frequently later. People say writing down something make it easier to achieve, :]]] I will try it. Good night my friend.
