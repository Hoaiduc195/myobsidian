Hello everyone, I'm gonna have a midterm exam in next 2 weeks. I have no idea but I think this exam can change me in some way. I don't know if I'm so excessively confident or just being dumb and lazy.

In few weeks ago I have learnt many cool stuff. DSA is so freaking terrible, but I love it, now I know how they feel when they can solve a problem. And I think I knew a source to gain more knowledge in algorithms and data structure. In future, I have to update my skills and soon become a _asd_, then I have to find it.

I will note something I have learn today below:
	+ Using merge sort to count inversions.
	+ AVL => construct an deque with operations at most O(nlogn) time complexity.
	+ Using backtrack technique more efficiently.

May be I will note longer in the next time.
