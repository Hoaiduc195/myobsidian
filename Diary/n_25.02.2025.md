Hello everybody, I'm very happy to be here tonight, I have come over 3 days on school and it's going exactly how I expected (*I mean it's really hard*) but I like this life, just learning new things, maybe I will change after the midterm exams :))).

By the way, one of my favorite *guys*, NHMH, sent me a friend request, haha I really appreciate it. Currently, Idk how to talk with her, you know I'm still so shy to talk in person with a female, I really hope me and that guy can befriend or further :))) idk but I think in this time I won't be so hurried, instead I will try other approach to be closer and be mutual better. She can be the key to change this boring and repetitive university life and I have to acquire that key.

Another stuff is that my old physics teacher, Ms. Chi, was right about Physics in university. It's fvcking hard, wtf am I learning??? I'm beginning to feel hate my old head-master - HNT, He inspired a great hate of Physics and let his students to become some type of physics-dumb guys.
I'm planning to restudy all 10th grade fundamental physics to keep track with those guys in my Physics class. Am I so ambitious?

My Calculus Lecturer is quite good, he even prepare a replay for us. I think he is a harshly grader, I have to prepare for that. By the way, his lecturing ability is really amazing, I can understand immediately, maybe all Calculus Lecturer I've seen all have good sense of pedagogy.

Tomorrow, I'm looking forwards to meeting my Linear Algebra Lecturer, I hope he will be a friendly guy. :))))


I have to go now, have a good night my friends.
