It's me today, haha, today I think I'm doing nothing, haizz it's quite weird to me because I have been so motivating when get the bad result and became so lazy when my result is better. I think I don't really want to develop myself to be a "*perfect guy*" or something else. Maybe I have to change this. or no? I think my vacation has just been started, it just start when I get full result.

Another thing is that one of my "old" friends, LTN, texted me this noon, I think she's getting better in her life, although with her manner, maybe she could have got in may troubles. I hope our friendship can last long, she's such a good guy. I remember when we were in 9th grade, I got angry with her when he intentionally post my old picture on her Facebook, we almost not talk to each other for 2 weeks, I was so bad that time. Now we has become freshmen, maybe soon we will have jobs and will be hard to meet again. In 12th grade, she even gave me her social account so that I could have access to learn Math online, I think she own me something and I have to pay her in some day. 

How DP is that hard, I cannot even understand the idea of this technique, how can a technique can be that complicating. Should I learn more about it or just get rid of all and continue practicing my learnt topic? I afraid of wasting time on something futile for me.

Haizz I'm quite lazy now so
