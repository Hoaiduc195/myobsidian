It has been a long time since the last note, Hello everyone, nice to meet you today.

It has been about a month since I started the second semester. This semester is quite boring, I admit, this is not what I expect but I think I still have to step on. 

I have learn some new algorithms which are extremely useful to solve some problems. May be I will list them here.
	- KMP Algorithm: String matching with linear time complexity.
	- Hare and Tortoise Algorithm: Checking cycle in list.
	- Moore Voting Algorithm: Find dominant element.
Also I found new techniques:
	- Difference array: Range update with linear time complexity.
	- ....
I will list more when I remember.

I tried WSL to use Linux simultaneously with Windows and it's really amazing, I should have known it sooner.

Yesterday I request friend with NLH but she hasn't reply me. I don't know why, may be she removed Facebook? Or she just don't want me to be her friend :(). I'm so stupid.

This note end here.
