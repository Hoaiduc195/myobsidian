Hello everybody, I'm can wait to notice that I have register for a courses online. It's called OPLC, I don't know what that means but I think even I didn't register for my school's optional English course, I still can learn English on my own.

I'm very excited and can't help to start my writing and speaking courses, I intend to register for TOEIC in this summer, but in my priority, I want to improve my skill and apply it to my job as well.

I'm learning some new words before going to bed, today is so long.

In this noon, my mom was scammed and that guy steal our product. I think he will meet something bad soon.

By the way, why my DSA courses is quite strange, I don't know why but may be after this course, I can join those contests online and become a better coder. :)))) Oh I remember, my teacher is quite young, he may be very polite and gentle but I think he can be very strict as well. Hope good come here.
