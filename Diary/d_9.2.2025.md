It's me today ahahahahaaahahaha, omg I can believe it, I got my Calculus result this morning and it's quite good, omg I don't think my result is that good, maybe I this is a gift from the above :))). Am I crazyyy ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Last night my boss asked me to join his party with his nephews and acquaintance, I drink a little much and became drunk drastically, then when I went home and I vomitted, omg it's quite fun to me although they are different-aged with me. 

Now I have enough motivation to continue my career, let's goo0o0o0o0o Duckie.

And in this semester I decided not to register for the English course because they're all suck to me, lecturers won't teach anything good to improve. Instead of that, I will register for an online course to learn myself, maybe I will choose Prep to start my English learning.

May be, in the next semester, I have to prepare my skill and go up. And after studying DSA, I have to test my problem-solving skill and algorithms, I want to enroll in some contest on Codeforces, hope I will reach my dream elo.

My result in this semester will be the premise for the me to cope with the next semester, I hope it will help me.

Today I think I'm having a day-off, see all you again.

Postscript: I will have my course registration tomorrow so I think today I will go to bed soon. This semester I choose martial arts as my PE courses and I decided not to register for English. May be I will change my Physics course to meet my friend or he will change his to meet me. Hope I will make more friends or "relationships" in this semester.
