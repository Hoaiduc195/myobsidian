Hello everybody, today I'm preparing myself before coming back to school. I noticed that there are some guys I know from the previous class. Maybe I can befriend them in some days.

Today Pi has its price, one of my friends, TAH, has accumulated Pi coins since we were in high school, maybe he will be rich in one night. I remember he say his family is really good at making money, I have no idea bout it but he maybe success in his favorite career.

Today I spent almost all of my day practicing Leetcode, today I encountered many hard problems, and I think it is becoming harder and harder. I hope when I study DSA I can be involved in CP as soon as possible. I think CP can be a way to make me more pro (?). haha

And about the novel, I think it's quite far:)))). I'm extremely lazy when the day I come back is coming. May be I will do this plan in my summertime.

And recently I have exercised more, I decided I won't training my legs anymore. Instead, I will focus on my arm and chest, because even if my legs can be smaller after that, it's possible and obvious that can be bigger in some day. Therefore, in order to make my legs look smaller, I will make my upper body bigger :))). Hope I can maintain this hobby long.
